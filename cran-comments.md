A patch to fix the problems at https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rust.html

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Test environments

- Debian Linux, clang (R-devel) on R-hub
- Fedora Linux, clang (R-devel) on R-hub
- macOS (R-release), ubuntu (R-oldrel, R-release, R-devel), windows (R-release) using the rcmdcheck package

## Downstream dependencies

Apart from notes unrelated to rust, the downstream dependencies of rust (bang, DSSP, lite, revdbayes and threshr) passed R CMD check. (I will fix these notes for bang and threshr shortly.)
